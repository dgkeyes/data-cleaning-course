## Data cleaning:
</br>

.large[
A spectrum of **reusable data transformations**  to make data **usable** and to obtain more meaningful results from our analysis or visualization methods.] 
</br>
--
.large[
Has no single end product, because different systems and methods consume different input data formats and structures.] 

---

##Cleaning data involves:

--

.large[
**1\.** Identifying specific **issues** that hinder an analysis, visualization, or reporting workflow.]  

--
.large[
**2\.** Determining which approach or tool is needed to address each issue.] 

--
.large[
**3\.** Transforming the data, making it more appropriate and valuable for a variety of downstream purposes.

# Common issues

.fl.w-50[
.large[
- Non-rectangular data  
- Unusable variable names
- Whitespace 
- Inconsistent letter case  
- Missing/implicit/misplaced grouping variables
]]

.fl.w-50[
.large[
- Compound values  
- Duplicated values  
- Broken values  
- Empty rows and columns  
- Numbers stored as text  
]]

---

## Why data cleaning
</br>
--
.large[
- Enables downstream tasks by making data readable & usable  
]
--
.large[
- Saves time (rows and columns in a data object ready for use)  
]
--
.large[
- Avoid potentially costly delays, or misinterpretations
]

---

## Why data cleaning in R
</br>
--
.large[
- Document and reproduce the process  
]
--
.large[
- Less time editing manually  
]
--
.large[
- Purpose-built tools available and well documented
]
--
.large[
- Code can be reproduced and repurposed

# Data cleaning is analysis

---

### When we clean data, we make judgements and interpretations
</br>
.large[
- Are the data in a usable structure?

- What constitutes 'unwanted' variation?

- Is there any implicit information that needs to made explicit?

- What to do about missing data.

.large[After identifying issues in our data, we decide which tool is best suited to address them.]

# This is also data analysis.

]

.large[
**2\.** Download course materials (data needed for "your turn" exercises) with 
ðŸ“¦ .b.rrured[`usethis`]]  


```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("usethis") # Install first if necessary
usethis::use_course("FINALURLHERE") # Download course materials 
```

.large[
**3\.** Copy the downloaded materials to the folder containing the RStudio project you created for this course.
